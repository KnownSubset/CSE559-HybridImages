##Algorithm

1. Obtain the high frequency parts of one image by filtering image with Gaussian Filter.

    ```matlab
    >%Image is already available
    >hs =50;
    >fftsize = 1024;
    >%The cutoff frequency ends up being implemented as the "sigma" that defines the Gaussian filter, and is a parameter that you have to play with to make the output images better
    >Gaussian = fspecial('gaussian', hs*2+1, sigma);
    >FftGaussian = fft2(Gaussian, fftsize, fftsize);
    >FftImage = fft2(Image, fftsize, fftsize);
    >ImageFiltered = ifft2(FftImage .* FftGaussian);
    >GaussianImageFiltered = ImageFiltered(1+hs:size(Image,1)+hs, 1+hs:size(Image,2)+hs);
    ```

2. Obtain the low frequency parts of another image by filtering image with Laplacian Filter.    

    ```matlab
    >%Image is already available
    >hs =50;
    >fftsize = 1024;
    >%The cutoff frequency ends up being implemented as the "sigma" that defines the Gaussian filter, and is a parameter that you have to play with to make the output images better
    >Gaussian = fspecial('gaussian', hs*2+1, sigma);
    >FftGaussian = fft2(Gaussian, fftsize, fftsize);
    >FftImage = fft2(Image, fftsize, fftsize);
    >ImageFiltered = ifft2(FftImage .* FftGaussian);
    >ImageFiltered = ImageFiltered(1+hs:size(Image,1)+hs, 1+hs:size(Image,2)+hs);
    >%Laplacian Filter Image can be generated by taking the Image matrix subtracting the values from the same image filtered by a Gaussian Filter.
    >LaplacianFilteredImage = Image - ImageFiltered;
    ```

3. Generate Hybrid Image by adding the values of the images matrixes together

    ```matlab
    >HybridImage = GaussianImageFiltered + LaplacianFilteredImage;
    ```

##Results    


* Favorite two results

	I tried to find images that would have the same general shape when scaled to be roughly within a 1/3 size difference. For some of the images below I had to obtain a size ration of 1:1 like with the Buffalo Bill and skull.  Other aspects of the items in the images could mitigated through rotation or cropping.  Ideally one image subject would encompass the other image subject.  Throughout the process I had to modify the values used for sigma, the cutoff frequency, to increase/reduce the amount of the image feature used in the hybrid image so that the interpretation would be a function of the viewing distance.

_______

The two batmobile images did not produce a reasonable hybrid.  Each image contains features that are not encompassed by the other image. For instance, the wheel wells, nose, and tailfins were larger on the newer batmobile and more pronounced. The width of the older batmobile was larger than the newer batmobile.

	I made a _compelling_ hybrid image from two different images of the same scene.  The images came from Eirik Solheim's gallery [The four seasons in Norway 10mm HDR](http://www.flickr.com/photos/eirikso/sets/72157611683788489/)
